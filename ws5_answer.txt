For this assignment, I used mkdir to make a new folder to place all the IDs in.

1. cut -f2 amazon_file | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | awk '{print $2}' | head -10 > TOP1K.txt 
This was used to find the top customerID who reviewed the most. 


2. for custID in $(cat TOP1K.txt); do echo > "$custID".txt; done
This line took all the top users in the TOP1K file and made a .txt file for each customer ID.

3. for REVIEWS in $(cat *.txt); do grep "$REVIEWS" amazon_file > $REVIEWS".txt; done
Here, the line looped through all files that ended in .txt and grepped the IDs of the customer before printing them inside
the text files for each.


NOTE: I used a smaller sample size of 10 instead of 1000 as it was much quicker and since 1000 would take way too long to load for my 
computer under these lines.
